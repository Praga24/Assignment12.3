1.Explain the uses of NoSQL Databases in brief and list the current NoSQL databases which are available.

The traditional RDMS is not optimised for horizontal scaling out.
It supports only structured data.As nowadays majority of the data comes in a semi-structured or unstructured format.
It lacks in high velocity because it’s designed for only steady data.
It requires high licensing cost.

The above limitations of RDMS are overcame in NOSQL

It has a generic data model with Heterogeneous containers, including sets, maps, and arrays.
NoSQL analytics systems support runtime type identification and conversion so that custom business logic can be used to dictate analytic treatment of variation.
Data is stored in single tables as compared to joining multiple tables.
Adding more of the economical servers allows NoSQL databases to scale to handle more data.
Distributed databases can store and process a set of information on more than one device.

Current NoSQL databases:
MongoDB
Redis
Cassandra
CouchDB
HBase
Accumulo
Vertica

2.Explain the Differences between Hive and HBase in Brief with examples.
Hive is a query based language like SQL through which we can query the data that is stored on top of hdfs using HQL(Hive query language).
Hive queries are internally converted to mapreduce operations by the execution engine.
It doesnot provide row level update and delete , It only runs batch process on hadoop.

While, HBase is actually a database(NoSQL) in hadoop that provide row level update and delete.
We cannot perform the SQL queries on Hbase data instead we use HBase shell command to perform operations.
It is partitioned to tables, and tables are further split into column families.
